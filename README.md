# 4G and Full Fibre Analysis


## Executive Summary

The availability and adoption of 4G mobile and Full Fibre coverage in the UK are crucial, prompting the UK government to plan widespread promotion of these technologies. This study aims to understand their evolution, addressing two key questions:

1. How advanced is 4G coverage in the UK over the past five years in terms of nations and local authorities?
2. Are there any notable associations between the usage rates of 4G and Full Fibre connectivity in the UK, categorized by nations and local authorities?

Two datasets were analysed: one detailing mobile coverage, including 4G, and the other detailing fixed coverage, including Full Fibre. GeoJSON data were also included for national-level analysis of the UK. Techniques included line graphs, bar graphs, and K-means clustering to visualize and categorize connectivity levels.


## Introduction

The UK government is actively promoting the widespread adoption of 4G mobile and Full Fibre coverage due to their critical importance for connectivity. This study examines the evolution of these technologies over the past five years, focusing on their progress across different nations and local authorities. The analysis aims to uncover advancements in 4G coverage and explore any associations between the usage rates of 4G and Full Fibre connectivity in the UK.
